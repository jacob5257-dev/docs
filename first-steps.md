# First Steps

## Permission Check

Using the command `!!checkperms`, you can make sure that the bot has the permissions necessary for all commands.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the bot does not respond to any messages, check that it has the "Send Messages" permission.
{% endhint %}

## Set a Prefix

If your guild has many other bots, the prefixes of this bot and others may overlap. To change the bot's prefix, use `!!setprefix newprefix`. Right now, the bot does _not _support prefixes with spaces. This will be changed in a further update. If you need a prefix longer than 10 characters, please refer to our whitelisting program.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you forgot the bot's prefix, @mention the bot. If you need to reset the prefix, use `@!! resetprefix`.
{% endhint %}
