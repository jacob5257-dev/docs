# Slash Commands FAQ

### Why slash commands?

Slash commands are becoming the preferred method of command input as it improves privacy. They are also easier for everyone to see commands by every bot.

### Why not just stay with regular message commands?

Discord is making message content a privileged intent, meaning that after reaching 76 servers, Discord has to verify our intent. We believe that this is unnecessary, and therefore are moving to slash commands.

### I have the bot, where are the slash commands?

Slash commands require a special Oauth2 scope, click the link below to get them.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Slash commands require the bot to have the administrator permission. This will be changed by [Rollout 2](slash-commands-faq.md#wait-why-are-there-fewer-slash-commands-than-message-ones).
{% endhint %}

### Wait, why are there fewer slash commands than message ones?

The rollout of slash commands is staggered, and we will not transfer all of the message commands. Here is the latest rollout plan:

* [x] ~~Rollout 1: Slash commands are here! (Released 11/1/2021)~~
* [ ] Rollout 2: There's more! (To be released 11/11/2021)
* [ ] Rollout 3: Almost done! (To be released 11/25-30/2021)
* [ ] Rollout 4: Happy holidays: slash commands complete! (To be released 12/25/2021)

### When are message commands being removed?

Based on a vote conducted on 11/6/2021, message commands will be removed with Rollout 2.

### What about things based on messages?

As of right now, we will be sustaining both leveling and welcome/goodbye messages to be supported for as long as possible. Based on the information that we know right now, both systems should be able to run without the need of the intent as they do not need to access the actual content of the message. Updates will be posted in our server as they come.
